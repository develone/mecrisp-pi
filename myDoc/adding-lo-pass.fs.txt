If you add your forth file to that, it will get loaded into the fpga.

cat ../common-forth/coredefinitions.fs basisdefinitions.fs ../common/double.fs ../common/fixpoint.fs ../common-forth/insight-16kb.fs ../common-forth/lo-pass.fs > included.fs
../common-crosscompiler/icecreammachine-16kb build/nucleus.hex build/iceimage.hex included.fs > build/log.txt
bash: ../common-crosscompiler/icecreammachine-16kb: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
Tried on both a Raspberry Pi 5Gb an Windows 11 WSL same result.

sudo apt install gforth
export PATH=~/ultibo/core/fpc/bin/:$PATH
tar xvfz Downloads/oss-cad-suite-linux-arm64-20241128.tgz
